# ml_learn

Just a repo where I can try out things, learn ml, get good git habits. Wanted to make it public so that I can psychologically confront the "being seen" bias. idk, just having some fun. 

/notes is where I'll be tracking notes, cool papers I want to try and adapt etc. 
/proj will have the corresponding projects. 

structure is subject to change. idk if I want to include jupyter notebooks and etc, since they have some weird ways of interacting with git. maybe later, i'll add them in with git ignores to ignore cell refreshes. oh well. sticking with colab on one side and vscode on the other 

ciao, 
s.
